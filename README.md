# Note_Taker
## Description

The goal of this assignment was to write the code to handle the GET requests for changing pages, the GET request for displaying previous notes saved to db.json file and the POST request to save new notes to the db.json file and display the note. Previously saved note have an id (unlike initial example data) so that when clicked the details of the note can be displayed.

## Live Deployment link

The live deployment of the site can be found at: https://note-taker-pletzjd.herokuapp.com/

## Usage

On the 'notes' page the user is shown previously saved notes, if any, on the left (highlighted in red below) and place to fill out new notes on the right (highlighted in orange below).

Once the user has filled in both fields a 'save' button (in the form of a floppy disc icon) appears in the top right of the page (highlighted in red below). Next to this icon is a 'new note' button (in the form of a plus icon highlighted in orange below) which clears the right side of the page so a new note can be written
